Introduction

The Murder of History: A Critique of History Textbooks Used in Pakistan is a 1993 book by Khursheed Kamal Aziz, a renowned Pakistani historian. In this book, Aziz examines 66 history textbooks used in Pakistani schools and colleges from grade 5 to grade 14, and exposes the systematic distortion and manipulation of history in these textbooks. He argues that this distortion of history is having a devastating impact on the nation's identity, culture, and politics.

Aziz's book was a groundbreaking work, and it remains one of the most important critiques of history education in Pakistan. It has been praised by scholars and activists alike for its courage, rigor, and clarity. However, it has also been criticized by some for being too critical and for not offering any solutions to the problems that it identifies.

Summary

In The Murder of History, Aziz argues that Pakistani history textbooks are full of errors, omissions, distortions, fabrications, and propaganda. He provides numerous examples of these problems, such as:

* The textbooks glorify the role of the Muslim League in the creation of Pakistan, while downplaying the role of other nationalist parties, such as the Indian National Congress.
* The textbooks ignore or misrepresent the contributions of non-Muslim minorities to Pakistani society.
* The textbooks promote a narrow and sectarian view of Pakistani nationalism, and they demonize Pakistan's neighbors, India and Afghanistan.
* The textbooks whitewash the human rights abuses committed by the Pakistani military and other state institutions.

Aziz argues that the distortion of history in Pakistani textbooks is having a number of negative consequences, including:

* It is creating a generation of Pakistanis who are ignorant of their own history and culture.
* It is promoting hatred and intolerance towards other religious and ethnic groups.
* It is undermining the development of a democratic and pluralistic society in Pakistan.

Aziz concludes his book by calling for a radical overhaul of history education in Pakistan. He argues that Pakistani textbooks need to be rewritten in a way that is accurate, objective, and balanced. He also argues that history education should be taught in a way that promotes critical thinking and tolerance for different viewpoints.

The Murder of History is a powerful and important book. It is a must-read for anyone who is interested in the history of Pakistan, education, or human rights.
